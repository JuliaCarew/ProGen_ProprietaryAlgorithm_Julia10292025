1. Create Rooms
start with cubes making up four walls & floor
make sure there are doors on every wall (in the middle)
after generating, any door that isn't connected to a connection is filled with wall cubes
Rooms can have any size between min and max for X, Z
find anything that isn't an 'air' cube
will need a minimum distance to be placed away from other rooms (some may break this rule to be placed together)
floor will need to be a plane placed first, then place walls along outer edge (set height - 2/3)
move wall cubes to snap to plane's Y level + 0.5, X & Z- 0.5

made up of 2 parts
floor (do this first)

wall (do last)

floors will have generated shape, walls will be drawn on the outer tile of the floor

make grid to place rooms on
floor can be a certain X,Z grid size
walls are placed on the size edge

all rooms will be on this grid, check cells for logic like doors and connections

2. Connect Rooms
find doors 
find nearest door at a certain axis
create path along that axis until reaching the door
if door is not directly parallel to the connecting door, go along one axis until perpendicular, then go along the other.

3. Fill Rooms
fill with obstacles
or fill with water
fill map with noise of these objects first?
